= OpenShift 4 Registry

{doctitle} is a Commodore component to manage the image registry on OpenShift 4.
It creates a `configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io` object named `cluster` in order to configure the image registry of the cluster.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.

== Node Selector

A node selector is configured to only run the ingress controller pods on infra nodes.
By doing so, the registry can be run on only a subset of the worker nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the target cluster does have nodes with the infra role label set.
See the components defaults for the exact value.
